# PP Puncher
Yeah, it's a real game now.
Steam link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422150/PP_Puncher/

This is code only. So that means this repo doesn't have:
 - External Libraries (see below)
 - Resources (textures, music, sounds)

Here are things that people have done that I've used:
- Phaser JS (game engine)
- nwjs (v33.3 - required for greenworks for some reason, wraps js into an exe)
- Web2Exe (exports the game for different OS/architectures)
- greenworks (for the steam API)
